## Introduction
This project is the second project from [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project.


## How to play game
* Select two cards to make match. Your mission is to figure out matching cards as soon as possible.
* If matched, a pair of cards are turned to green. If it's not, the pair turns into red for a while and then flipped.
* If you figure out all the matching cards, you will see a congratulation-popup which shows your score.

## Features
* Cards are shuffled as you get into the game.
* You can retry the game by clicking restart button.
* You will see the orange-colored text if you make a match.
* On 'congratulation-popup', you will see spent-time, rating-stars and total moves you made until you figure out all matching cards.
